# Architecture Overview

> **⚠️ Work in Progress:** Vize is under active development and is not yet ready for production use. Internal architecture may change as the project evolves.

Vize is built as a modular Rust workspace where each crate handles a specific concern. The architecture follows a pipeline model, transforming Vue SFC source code through parsing, analysis, and compilation stages.

## Pipeline

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Source .vue] --> B[Armature<br/>Parser]
    B --> C[Relief<br/>AST]
    C --> D[Croquis<br/>Semantic Analysis]
    D --> E{Atelier}
    E --> F[DOM Compiler]
    E --> G[Vapor Compiler]
    E --> H[SSR Compiler]
    F --> I[Output JS]
    G --> I
    H --> I
```

### Stage Details

1. **Source** — A `.vue` file containing `<template>`, `<script>`, and `<style>` blocks
2. **Armature** (Parser) — Tokenizes the raw source into a stream of tokens, then parses them into a structured AST. The tokenizer handles Vue-specific syntax: directives (`v-if`, `v-for`, `v-bind`), expression interpolation (`{{ }}`), and SFC block boundaries.
3. **Relief** (AST) — The intermediate representation. All downstream stages operate on this shared AST, eliminating redundant parsing.
4. **Croquis** (Semantic Analysis) — Resolves template expressions, tracks variable scopes, detects binding types (setup, data, props, inject), and validates expression correctness. Uses OXC for JavaScript/TypeScript AST parsing.
5. **Atelier** (Compilation) — Transforms the analyzed AST into JavaScript output. Three backends serve different targets:
   - **DOM** (`vize_atelier_dom`) — `createVNode`/`h` calls with patch flag optimization and static hoisting
   - **Vapor** (`vize_atelier_vapor`) — Fine-grained reactive code with direct DOM manipulation (no VDOM)
   - **SSR** (`vize_atelier_ssr`) — String concatenation with hydration markers
6. **Output** — Generated JavaScript code with source maps

## Tool Pipeline

Beyond compilation, Vize provides additional tools that reuse the same parsing and analysis infrastructure:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Source .vue] --> B[Armature<br/>Parser]
    B --> C[Relief<br/>AST]
    C --> D[Croquis<br/>Analysis]
    D --> E[Atelier<br/>Compiler]
    C --> F[Patina<br/>Linter]
    C --> G[Glyph<br/>Formatter]
    D --> H[Canon<br/>Type Checker]
    C --> I[Musea<br/>Gallery]
    D --> J[Maestro<br/>LSP]
```

Because all tools share the same parser and AST, they have a consistent understanding of your code. A lint rule in Patina operates on the same AST nodes as the compiler in Atelier — there's no risk of parser disagreement.

## Naming Convention

Vize crates are named after **art and sculpture terminology**, reflecting how each component shapes and transforms Vue code. This naming system is more than aesthetic — it encodes the role and relationships between crates. See [Philosophy](../philosophy.md) for the full rationale.

| Name         | Origin       | Art Analogy                                              | Technical Role                                                                 |
| ------------ | ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Carton**   | /kɑːˈtɒn/    | Artist's portfolio case — stores and organizes tools     | Shared utilities — the foundational toolbox that every crate depends on        |
| **Relief**   | /rɪˈliːf/    | Sculptural technique that projects from a flat surface   | The AST — a structured surface that gives shape to raw source code             |
| **Armature** | /ˈɑːrmətʃər/ | Internal skeleton supporting a sculpture                 | The parser — the structural framework that supports the AST                    |
| **Croquis**  | /kʁɔ.ki/     | Quick gestural sketch capturing the essence of a subject | Semantic analysis — a quick pass that captures the meaning of code             |
| **Atelier**  | /ˌætəlˈjeɪ/  | Artist's workshop where creation happens                 | Compiler workspaces — where code is transformed into its final form            |
| **Vitrine**  | /vɪˈtriːn/   | Glass display case in a museum                           | Bindings — a transparent layer that exposes the compiler to external consumers |
| **Canon**    | /ˈkænən/     | Standard of ideal proportions in classical sculpture     | Type checker — ensures code conforms to the standard of correctness            |
| **Patina**   | /ˈpætɪnə/    | Aged surface finish that indicates quality and care      | Linter — polishes code by identifying issues that affect quality               |

### Why Art Terminology?

The analogy between software compilation and artistic creation is surprisingly deep:

- A **parser** (Armature) provides the internal skeleton — the structure that everything else builds upon, just as a sculptor's armature supports the clay
- **Semantic analysis** (Croquis) is like a quick sketch — it captures the essential meaning without committing to a final form
- The **compiler** (Atelier) is a workshop where raw material is transformed into a finished work
- The **AST** (Relief) is a projection — it gives three-dimensional structure to what was originally flat text
- **Bindings** (Vitrine) are a glass display case — they let you see and interact with the work inside without directly touching it
- The **linter** (Patina) examines the surface finish — finding imperfections that affect the overall quality
- The **formatter** (Glyph) ensures consistent proportions — like a typographer carving letterforms with precise spacing

This naming convention makes the crate hierarchy intuitive: when you see `vize_atelier_dom`, you immediately understand it is a _workshop_ that produces _DOM output_.
